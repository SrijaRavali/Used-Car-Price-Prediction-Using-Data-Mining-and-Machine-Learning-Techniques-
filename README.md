# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Used car market is expanding very fast all over the 
world. Price prediction for used cars becomes an essential topic 
and exploited by many researchers in recent years. where several 
factors influence the pricing of vehicles. In this research, we 
explore the use of data mining and machine learning techniques 
on predicting the prices of used cars in three different regions 
namely Europe, the US, and Germany, using Two popular 
algorithms, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for 
classification, were implemented using two widely used libraries 
in the machine learning community they are Scikit-learn 
(SKlearn) and LightGBM, respectively. The datasets used in this 
study contains information on various attributes of used cars, 
such as make, model, year, mileage, and other technical 
specifications and various metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the models' 
performance. Our findings suggest that Random forest 
outperforms KNN in terms of accuracy and consistency across all 
three datasets when using SKLearn Library and KNN 
outperforms Random Forest when used LightGBM library. Our 
study contributes to the understanding of the used car market 
and provides insights into the potential use of data mining and 
machine learning techniques for predicting used car prices.
